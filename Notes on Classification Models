###Evaluation of Classification Models

#Binary Classification: positive, negative [class, scores]

##CONFUSION MATRIX: TP, FN, FP, TN
* True Positive (TP): number of observations that are predicted positive and they are correct
                accuracy = (TP + FN)/n
                error = 1 - accuracy
##RECALL/ SENSITIVITY


##PRECISION/ POSITIVE PREDICTION VALUE (PPV)
