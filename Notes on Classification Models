###Evaluation of Classification Models

#Binary Classification: positive, negative [class, scores]

##CONFUSION MATRIX: TP, FN, FP, TN
* True Positive (TP): number of observations that are predicted positive and they are correct

                accuracy = (TP + FN)/n
                error = 1 - accuracy
                
##RECALL/ SENSITIVITY (TPR) - what % of instances in postive class are predicted class?

                p(pred +/Actuall +) = TP/ (TP+FN)

##PRECISION/ POSITIVE PREDICTION VALUE (PPV) - what % of positive predicted are correct?
      
                p(Actual +/pred +) = TP/ (TP+FP)

##F score

                F-score = 2*Precision*Recall /Precision*Recall
                
#Other measures: 

                False - alarm (fpr) = p(pred+/ Actual-) = FP / (TN+FP)
                Specificity = p (pred - / Actual -) = TN/ TN+FP = 1- false-alarm
