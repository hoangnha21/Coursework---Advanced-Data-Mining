# Coursework---Advanced-Data-Mining (R/R Studio)

Nowadays, almost every organization collects data, which can be analyzed in order to make better decisions, improve policies, discover computer network intrusion patterns, design new drugs, detect credit fraud, make accurate diag- noses, predict important events, monitor, evaluate reliability and preempt failures of complex systems, etc.

Data mining involves a collection of techniques for extracting patterns and trends in large databases. This course covers the most important techniques used in data mining.On the algorithmic side, I learn about the main data mining techniques: decision trees, random forest, linear and logistic regression models, support vector machines distance-based models, neural networks, clustering, and etc. 

Expectations: Focus on the implementation of predictive/clustering algorithms
